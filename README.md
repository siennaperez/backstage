# Backstage

Hi hi! This is a project I created for the UF WiCSE x AMEX Shadowing program. It reflects my love for concerts by connecting users together based on events in common. More details can be found below the run instructions.

## How to Run

This project was built in Flutter, however, I deployed this "mobile app" via Chrome, using the following: 
- "flutter pub get" to update your dependencies
- "flutter run -d chrome" to open locally in a minimized chrome window

To connect your own API key, a .env file will need the following format: 

      API_KEY=
      APP_ID=
      MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
      PROJECT_ID=
      AUTH_DOMAIN=
      STORAGE_BUCKET=
      MEASUREMENT_ID=
      TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=
